# BaiduPhoneScreenBible

This repository includes a Markdown file containing the most recent 50 Google phone interview technical problems. There might be duplicated problems, which indicates that they are very likely to be asked in the phone interview.

All questions are from the BBS of [1point3acres](http://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/). So they are all in Chinese (Sorry, non Chinese speakers). Many thanks to those who contributed the problems and the interview experiences. That's a great help for the people who are preparing for the interview, like me.

This repo also includes the solution in C++ in the folder BaiduPhoneBible. That's what I have written to solve the problems. Any comments, pull requests are welcome! Let's try to crack and improve the implementation!


A link to the original post in [1point3acres](http://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/) are attached in each problem. So you can check out the discussion if you can read Chinese.

Good luck to everyone!
